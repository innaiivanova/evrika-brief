It's flipping the box around, right? It's turning it over. It's looking at it completely differently. Two of my favorite designers, Charles and Ray Eames. So if you've ever seen the Eames Lounge, mid-century modern designers, amazing designers. They created a documentary in 1977 with IBM. It's called Powers of 10. If you've never seen this, you should definitely watch it. You can find it on YouTube. It's only like nine minutes long. If you're like me, you'll watch it again and again and again. And what they did is they start with a picnic next to a lake and they start to zoom the camera back. And every 10 seconds, they zoom the camera back another power of 10. So"", ""so much of the way we talk about running organizations is built around preserving the downside, avoiding mistakes, avoiding errors, under promise and over deliver, slow and steady wins the race. I mean, the fact that we so many times just continuously chase our competition. Now the problem is that Kodak, in this example, they were a 10% company, and they needed to be a 10X company. 10X, 10 times, an order of magnitude. It's a moonshot. At Google, we call 10X moonshots. If you're only aiming for 10%, you're taking the obvious path that everyone else is on. You know, Kodak, continuing to grow the film market. That wasn't obvious. They knew how that was going to go. But if you aim for 10X, you have to think completely different about the problem. If you want to build a car that gets 50 miles to the gallon, you kind of know how to do that, right? But if you want to build a car that gets 500 miles to the gallon, you have to completely throw out everything you think about making cars. You"", ""point you're probably thinking, you work at Google, sounds great. I don't work at Google or SpaceX. This sounds fine to throw all this time and money and energy into these 1% payoffs.

You got a lot of money, you got a lot of people, what's the worst that can happen? You fail but you have an existing business to fall back on. But then you talk to big companies and they say, that sounds great for a startup. What do you have to lose? The company's gonna go out of business. You don't have customers, you don't have revenue to sacrifice. And what I want to do today is convince you that 10x is just a way of thinking about building products and it has nothing to do with whether you're Google or you're SpaceX or you work for the government or you work for the railroad industry. 10x is a way to think about solving problems. The first thing you need"", ""nothing to do with whether you're Google or you're SpaceX or you work for the government or you work for the railroad industry. 10x is a way to think about solving problems. The first thing you need to recognize when you think about 10x is that failure has to be an option. Astro uses the example of an explorer. Imagine that a team of explorers sends a bunch of scouts out and says, see if you can find a mountain. Let's say the scouts come back a few weeks later, they didn't find a mountain. If you shame them, if you punish those scouts, you fire them, they're not going to go look for any mountains again. They're not going to take those kinds of chances. But the interesting thing that happens when you fail is that you learn something new and learning is knowledge. So if you fail trying something ambitious, chances are maybe you've succeeded doing something pretty amazing. Maybe you didn't find the mountain but you found a water source or you found a village. So when you try and fail and"", ""more weeks of effort do we have left? That's measuring effort. That's not measuring impact. When JFK challenged NASA to put a man on the moon, he didn't say, let's launch 15 rockets, stretch goal of 20. He said, land a man on the moon. Let's go. Measure it. That's the impact we want to have. With 10X, you need to have an emphasis on the impact you want to have. One of the reasons for that is because you don't necessarily know how you're going to get there. If you as a PM can lay out all the steps that need to happen between now and when it's done, it's by definition probably not going to be a 10X thing. Because we don't know. We have to find out. It sounds like 10%, and that's fine for a lot of projects, but that's not right for 10X. Again, we will accomplish X, not we will do Y. Again, sometimes 10X is easier than 10%.

What is compound interest of habits?,"[""that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power, a component of the system of compound growth. After Summary Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1% better every day counts for a lot in the long run. Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Chapter 2. How Your Habits Shape Your Identity, and Vice Versa Why is it so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones? Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits. And yet, it is likely that this time next year, you'll be doing the same thing rather than something better. It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation. Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle. However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever, especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best intentions, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much television, procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break. Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons. One, we try to change the wrong thing, and two, we try to change our habits in the wrong way. In this chapter, I'll address the first point. In the chapters that follow, I'll answer the second. Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. To understand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which change can occur. You can imagine them like the layers of an onion. An image and graphical representation of these layers is available at AtomicHabits.com. The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with changing your results – losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level. The second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems – implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level. The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs – your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases that you hold are associated with this level. Systems are about what you get, processes are about what you do, identity is about what you believe. When it comes to building habits that last, when it comes to building a system of 1% improvements, the problem is not that one level is better or worse than another. All levels of change are useful in their own way. The problem is the direction of change. Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become. Again, an example of the difference between these two is available at AtomicHabits.com slash media. Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, no thanks, I'm trying to quit. It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, no thanks, I'm not a smoker. It's a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes. Most people don't even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, I want to be skinny, outcome. And if I stick to this diet, then I'll be skinny, process. They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive"", ""Angeles to New York City. If a pilot, leaving from LAX, adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington D.C. instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff, the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet, but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart. I geeked out and actually calculated this. Washington D.C. is about 225 miles from New York City, assuming you're flying on a 747 or an Airbus A380, changing the heading by 3.5 degrees as you leave Los Angeles likely causes the nose of the airplane to shift between 7.2 and 7.6 feet, or about 86 to 92 inches. So a very small shift in direction can lead to a very meaningful change in destination. Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1% better or 1% worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime, these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. That said, it doesn't matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. If you're a millionaire, but you spend more than you earn each month, then you're on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don't change, it's not going to end well. Conversely, if you're broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you're on the path toward financial freedom, even if you're moving slower than you'd like. Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat. If you want to predict where you'll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self. Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally, bad habits make time your enemy. Your habits can compound for you or against you. Here are some examples of positive compounding. Productivity Compounds Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but accounts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas. Knowledge Compounds Learning one new idea won't make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new, but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, that's how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. Relationships Compound People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time. And here are some examples of negative compounding. Stress Compounds The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities. The worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves, these common causes of stress are manageable, but when they persist for years, little stresses compound into serious health issues. Negative Thoughts Compound The more you think of yourself as worthless or stupid or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere. Outrage Compounds Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely the result of a single event. Instead, a long series of microaggressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and outrage spreads like wildfire. Habits are a double-edged sword."", ""the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves. Problem number three. Goals restrict your happiness. The implicit assumption behind any goal is this. Once I reach my goal, then I'll be happy. The problem with a goals first mentality is that you're continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. I've slipped into this trap so many times I've lost count. For years, happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained 20 pounds of muscle or after my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax. Furthermore, goals create an either-or conflict. Either you achieve your goal and are successful, or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. A systems first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don't have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied any time your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the first one you envision. Problem number four. Goals are at odds with long-term progress. Finally, a goal-oriented mindset can create a yo-yo effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goalless thinking. It's not about any single accomplishment. It's about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. A system of atomic habits. If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again, not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings behind the word atomic. By now, you have probably realized that an atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1% improvement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant. But soon, they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits, a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power, a component of the system of compound growth. After Summary Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1% better every day counts for a lot in the long run. Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold.

For more information and updates on the British cycling team and their strategies, visit atomichabits.com slash cycling. How does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary athletes transform into world champions with tiny changes that, at first glance, would seem to make a modest difference at best? Why do small improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you replicate this approach in your own life? Why small habits make a big difference It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about. Meanwhile, improving by 1% isn't particularly notable, sometimes it isn't even noticeable, but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here's how the math works out. If you can get 1% better each day for one year, you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done. Conversely, if you get 1% worse each day for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more. You can see a graphical representation of this idea at AtomicHabits.com slash media. This is also where you'll be able to access all of the pictures from this book. Again, that link is AtomicHabits.com slash media. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day, and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back 2, 5, or perhaps 10 years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones become strikingly apparent. This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often dismiss small changes because they don't seem to matter very much in the moment. If you save a little money now, you're still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you're still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven't learned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly, and so we slide back into our previous routines. Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn't move much. If you work late and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss, but when we repeat 1% errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It's the accumulation of many missteps, a 1% decline here and there, that eventually leads to a problem. The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot, leaving from LAX, adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington D.C. instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff, the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet, but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.

Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade. What Progress Is Really Like Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently 25 degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up. 26 degrees. 27. 28. The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you. 29 degrees. 30. 31. Still, nothing has happened. Then 32 degrees. The ice begins to melt. A 1 degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80% of its life undetectable and then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first 5 years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding 90 feet into the air within 6 weeks. Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a valley of disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere. It's a hallmark of any compounding process. The most powerful outcomes are delayed. This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, I've been running every day for a month, so why can't I see any change in my body? Once this kind of thinking takes over, it's easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau, what I call the plateau of latent potential. If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the plateau of latent potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from 25 to 31 degrees. Your work was not wasted, it is just being stored. All of the action happens at 32 degrees. When you finally break through the plateau of latent potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event, rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it's the work you did long ago, when it seemed that you weren't making any progress, that makes the jump today possible. It is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic plates can grind against one another for millions of years, the tension slowly building all the while. Then, one day, they rub each other once again in the same fashion as they have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An earthquake erupts. Change can take years before it happens all at once."", ""by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become. Again, an example of the difference between these two is available at AtomicHabits.com slash media. Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, no thanks, I'm trying to quit. It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, no thanks, I'm not a smoker. It's a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes. Most people don't even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, I want to be skinny, outcome. And if I stick to this diet, then I'll be skinny, process. They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don't realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change. Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of democracy, for example, is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and social equality. The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of beliefs, like absolute authority and strict obedience. You can imagine many ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy, but such behavior change would never get off the ground in a dictatorship. That's not the identity of the system. Voting is a behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs. A similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals, organizations, or societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits. Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you'll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you'll be drawn to relaxing rather than training. It's hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven't changed who you are. The story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado, provides a good example. For as long as I can remember, I've chewed my fingernails, Clark told me. It started as a nervous habit when I was young and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual. One day, I resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit. Through mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it. Then Clark did something surprising. I asked my wife to schedule my first ever manicure, he said. My thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn't chew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the first time. The manicurist even said that, other than the chewing, I had really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of my fingernails. And even though that's something I had never aspired to, it made all the difference. I've never chewed my nails since, not even a single close call, and it's because I now take pride in properly caring for them. The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It's one thing to say, I'm the type of person who wants this. It's something very different to say, I'm the type of person who is this. The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you're proud of how your hair looks, you'll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you're proud of the size of your biceps, you'll make sure you never skip an upper body workout. If you're proud of the scarves you knit, you'll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you'll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits. True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you'll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.

When we were creating the Macintosh, we were not trying to make a slightly better Apple II, or a slightly better MS-DOS machine. We were trying to jump to the next curve of personal computing. The greatest example of this occurs in the ice business. Ice 1.0, in the late 1800s, early 1900s, there was an ice harvesting business in the United States. This meant that Bubba and Junior, during winter, would go to a frozen lake or a pond, cut blocks of ice. Nine million pounds of ice was harvested in 1900. Their idea of innovation was bigger horse, more horses, bigger sleigh, sharper saw. But it was fundamentally, wait for winter, live in a cold city, cut blocks of ice. 30 years later, we have ice 2.0. Now we have the ice factory. Major technological breakthrough. It did not have to be winter. It did not have to be a cold city. You froze water centrally and delivered it"", ""refrigerator companies, because most companies define themselves in terms of what they do, not the benefits they provide. If you define yourself as we cut blocks of ice out of lakes, you remain an ice harvester. If you define yourself as we freeze water centrally, you remain an ice factory. If you define yourself as we make a mechanical gadget called a refrigerator, then you stay on the refrigerator curve. Great innovation occurs when you get to the next curve, when you go from telephone to internet, when you go from daisy wheel printer to laser printer to 3D printing, great innovation occurs on the next curve. The fourth thing is to roll the dicey. These are the five qualities of great innovation. Great innovation is deep, lots of features, lots of functionality. This is a picture of a fanning sandal made by Reef, arguably the deepest sandal ever made. Every sandal has one primary purpose, to protect your feet. If you look at that circled area, that's a metal clip. That metal clip is"", ""later, we have ice 2.0. Now we have the ice factory. Major technological breakthrough. It did not have to be winter. It did not have to be a cold city. You froze water centrally and delivered it via the ice man in the ice truck. Imagine the breakthrough this was. No more limitations by climate, no more limitations by season. You could have an ice factory. 30 years go by, we have ice 3.0. Refrigerator curve. Now, now, it's not a matter of can you freeze water centrally, can you put it in a truck, can you deliver the ice to people. Now, everybody could have their own personal ice factory. A PC, if you will, a personal chiller. The very interesting story about all of these curves is that none of the organizations that were ice harvesters became ice factories, and ice factories did not become refrigerator companies, because most companies define themselves in terms of what they do, not the benefits they provide. If you define yourself as we cut blocks of ice out of lakes, you remain an"", ""your product. Change it, change it, and change it, and keep evolving it. Number nine is all the marketing you need to know. It is to niche thyself. It's a very simple chart. On the vertical axis, we measure uniqueness. On the horizontal axis, we measure value. This is a two-by-two matrix. For those of you, when you graduate, if you go to work for McKinsey, you'll be charging $5 million for people to figure out that they want to be in the upper right-hand corner of this chart. Let's go through all corners. In the bottom right corner, that's where you have something of great value, but it's not unique. There, you have to compete on price. This is what I call the Dell corner. Slap the same operating system on the same hardware, you have to compete on price. In the opposite corner, you have something truly unique. Only you do it, but it is of no value. In that corner, you are just plain stupid. All right? Bottom left corner, we call that the USC corner.

It involves moving from one stage of technology or business model to a fundamentally different one, as illustrated by the evolution from ice harvesting to ice factories and then to refrigerators. Instead of merely enhancing existing products, jumping curves means redefining what a product or service can be by focusing on the benefits it provides rather than the specific tasks it performs. This approach encourages companies to innovate deeply and embrace major technological breakthroughs.","Jumping Curves refers to the concept of moving beyond incremental improvements on an existing product or service (staying on the same curve) to make a significant leap in innovation that fundamentally changes the market or industry. This idea emphasizes the need to redefine and innovate by exploring completely new avenues and opportunities, rather than just making things slightly better. The speaker uses historical examples from the ice industry to illustrate how companies can fail to evolve if they cling to their original definition of their business instead of recognizing new possibilities.",1.0,0.7597731543699732,0.9999999999666667,1.0
What is the build measure learn loop?,"[""Introduction Stop me if you've heard this one before. Brilliant college kids sitting in a dorm are inventing the future. Heedless of boundaries, possessed of new technology and youthful enthusiasm, they build a new company from scratch. Their early success allows them to raise money and bring an amazing new product to market. They hire their friends, assemble a superstar team, and dare the world to stop them. 10 years and several startups ago, that was me, building my first company. I particularly remember a moment from back then, the moment I realized my company was going to fail. My co-founder and I were at our wits end. The dot-com bubble had burst, and we had spent all our money. We tried desperately to raise more capital, and we could not. It was like a breakup scene from a Hollywood movie. It was raining, and we were arguing in the street. We couldn't even agree on where to walk next, and so we parted in anger, heading in opposite directions. As a metaphor for our company's failure, this image of the two of us, lost in the rain and drifting apart, is perfect. It remains a painful memory. The company limped along for months afterward, but our situation was hopeless. At the time, it had seemed we were doing everything right. We had a great product, a brilliant team, amazing technology, and the right idea at the right time. And we really were onto something. We were building a way for college kids to create online profiles for the purpose of sharing. With employers. Oops. But despite a promising idea, we were nonetheless doomed from day one, because we did not know the process we would need to use to turn our product insights into a great company. If you've never experienced a failure like this, it is hard to describe the feeling. It's as if the world were falling out from under you. You realize you've been duped. The stories in the magazines are lies. Hard work and perseverance don't lead to success. Even worse, the many, many, many promises you've made to employees, friends, and family are not going to come true. Everyone who thought you were foolish for stepping out on your own will be proven right. It wasn't supposed to turn out that way. In magazines and newspapers, in blockbuster movies, and on countless blogs, we hear the mantra of the successful entrepreneurs. Through determination, brilliance, great timing, and, above all, a great product, you too can achieve fame and fortune. There is a myth-making industry hard at work to sell us that story, but I have come to believe that the story is false, the product of selection bias and after-the-fact rationalization. In fact, having worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs, I have seen firsthand how often a promising start leads to failure. The grim reality is that most startups fail, most new products are not successful, most new ventures do not live up to their potential. Yet the story of perseverance, creative genius, and hard work persists. Why is it so popular? I think there is something deeply appealing about this modern-day rags-to-riches story. It makes success seem inevitable if you just have the right stuff. It means that the mundane details, the boring stuff, the small individual choices don't matter. If we build it, they will come. When we fail, as so many of us do, we have a ready-made excuse, we didn't have the right stuff. We weren't visionary enough or weren't in the right place at the right time. After more than 10 years as an entrepreneur, I came to reject that line of thinking. I have learned from both my own successes and failures and those of many others that it's the boring stuff that matters the most. Startup success is not a consequence of good genes or being in the right place at the right time. Startup success can be engineered by following the right process, which means it can be learned, which means it can be taught. Entrepreneurship is a kind of management. No, you didn't read that wrong. We have wildly divergent associations with these two words, entrepreneurship and management. Lately, it seems that one is cool, innovative, and exciting and the other is dull, serious, and bland. It is time to look past these preconceptions. Let me tell you a second startup story. It's 2004, and a group of founders have just started a new company. Their previous company had failed very publicly. Their credibility is at an all-time low. They have a huge vision to change the way people communicate by using a new technology called avatars. Remember, this was before James Cameron's blockbuster movie.

It's 2004, and a group of founders have just started a new company. Their previous company had failed very publicly. Their credibility is at an all-time low. They have a huge vision to change the way people communicate by using a new technology called avatars. Remember, this was before James Cameron's blockbuster movie. They are following a visionary named Will Harvey, who paints a compelling picture. People connecting with their friends, hanging out online, using avatars to give them a combination of intimate connection and safe anonymity. Even better, instead of having to build all the clothing, furniture, and accessories these avatars would need to accessorize their digital lives, the customers would be enlisted to build those things and sell them to one another. The engineering challenge before them is immense. Creating virtual worlds, user-generated content, an online commerce engine, micropayments, and, last but not least, the three-dimensional avatar technology that can run on anyone's PC. I'm in this second story, too. I'm a co-founder and chief technology officer of this company, which is called IMVU. At this point in our journey, we are still in the early stages of our careers, my co-founders and I are determined to make new mistakes. We do everything wrong. Instead of spending years perfecting our technology, we build a minimum viable product, an early product that is terrible, full of bugs and crash-your-computer-yes-really stability problems. Then we ship it to customers way before it's ready, and we charge money for it. After securing initial customers, we change the product constantly, much too fast by traditional standards, shipping new versions of our product dozens of times every single day. We really did have customers in those early days, true visionary early adopters, and we often talked to them and asked for their feedback. But we emphatically did not do what they said. We viewed their input as only one source of information about our product and overall vision. In fact, we were much more likely to run experiments on our customers than we were to cater to their whims. Traditional business thinking says that this approach shouldn't work, but it does, and you don't have to take my word for it. As you'll see throughout this book, the approach we pioneered at IMVU has become the basis for a new movement of entrepreneurs around the world. It builds on many previous management and product development ideas, including lean manufacturing, design thinking, customer development, and agile development. It represents a new approach to creating continuous innovation. It's called the Lean Startup. Despite the volumes written on business strategy, the key attributes of business leaders, and ways to identify the next big thing, innovators still struggle to bring their ideas to life. This was the frustration that led us to try a radical new approach at IMVU, one characterized by an extremely fast cycle time, a focus on what customers want without asking them, and a scientific approach to making decisions. Origins of the Lean Startup I am one of those people who grew up programming computers, and so my journey to thinking about entrepreneurship and management has taken a circuitous path. I have always worked on the product development side of my industry. My partners and bosses were managers or marketers, and my peers worked in engineering and operations. Throughout my career, I kept having the experience of working incredibly hard on products that ultimately failed in the marketplace. At first, largely because of my background, I viewed these as technical problems that required technical solutions, better architecture, a better engineering process, better discipline, focus, or product vision. These supposed fixes led to still more failure. So I read everything I could get my hands on and was blessed to have had some of the top minds in Silicon Valley as my mentors. By the time I became a co-founder of IMVU, I was hungry for new ideas about how to build a company.

By the time I became a co-founder of IMVU, I was hungry for new ideas about how to build a company. I was fortunate to have co-founders who were willing to experiment with new approaches. They were fed up, as I was, by the failure of traditional thinking. Also, we were lucky to have Steve Blank as an investor and advisor. Back in 2004, Steve had just begun preaching a new idea. The business and marketing functions of a startup should be considered as important as engineering and product development and therefore deserve an equally rigorous methodology to guide them. He called that methodology customer development, and it offered insight and guidance to my daily work as an entrepreneur. Meanwhile, I was building IMVU's product development team using some of the unorthodox methods I mentioned earlier. Measured against the traditional theories of product development I had been trained on in my career, these methods did not make sense, yet I could see firsthand that they were working. I struggled to explain the practices to new employees, investors, and the founders of other companies. We lacked a common language for describing them and concrete principles for understanding them. I began to search outside entrepreneurship for ideas that could help me make sense of my experience. I began to study other industries, especially manufacturing, from which most modern theories of management derive. I studied lean manufacturing, a process that originated in Japan with the Toyota production system, a completely new way of thinking about the manufacturing of physical goods. I found that by applying ideas from lean manufacturing to my own entrepreneurial challenges with a few tweaks and changes, I had the beginnings of a framework for making sense of them. This line of thought evolved into the Lean Startup, the application of lean thinking to the process of innovation. IMVU became a tremendous success. IMVU customers have created more than 60 million avatars. It is a profitable company with annual revenues of more than $50 million in 2011, employing more than a hundred people in our current offices in Mountain View, California. IMVU's virtual goods catalog, which seemed so risky years ago, now has more than six million items in it, more than 7,000. Are added every day, almost all created by customers. As a result of IMVU's success, I began to be asked for advice by other startups and venture capitalists. When I would describe my experiences at IMVU, I was often met with blank stares or extreme skepticism. The most common reply was, that could never work. My experience so flew in the face of conventional thinking that most people, even in the innovation hub of Silicon Valley, could not wrap their minds around it. Then I started to write, first on a blog called Startup Lessons Learn and Speak at Conferences. And to companies, startups, and venture capitalists, to anyone who would listen. In the process of being called on to defend and explain my insights and with the collaboration of other writers, thinkers, and entrepreneurs, I had a chance to refine and develop the theory of the lean startup beyond its rudimentary beginnings. My hope all along was to find ways to eliminate the tremendous waste I saw all around me, startups that built products nobody wanted, new products pulled from the shelves, countless dreams unrealized. Eventually, the lean startup idea blossomed into a global movement. Entrepreneurs began forming local in-person groups to discuss and apply lean startup ideas. There are now organized communities of practice in more than a hundred cities around the world. One my travels have taken me across countries and continents.

Everywhere I have seen the signs of a new entrepreneurial renaissance. The lean startup movement is making entrepreneurship accessible to a whole new generation of founders who are hungry for new ideas about how to build successful companies. Although my background is in high-tech software entrepreneurship, the movement has grown way beyond those roots. Thousands of entrepreneurs are putting lean startup principles to work in every conceivable industry. I've had the chance to work with entrepreneurs in companies of all sizes, in different industries, and even in government. This journey has taken me to places I never imagined I'd see, from the world's most elite venture capitalists, to fortune 500 boardrooms, to the pentagon. The most nervous I have ever been in a meeting was when I was attempting to explain lean startup principles to the chief information officer of the US army, who is a three-star general. For the record, he was extremely open to new ideas, even from a civilian like me. Pretty soon I realized that it was time to focus on the lean startup movement full-time. My mission was to educate the world about lean startup principles, the lean startup method. This is a book for entrepreneurs and the people who hold them accountable. The five principles of the lean startup, which inform all three parts of this book, are as follows. 1. Entrepreneurs are everywhere. You don't have to work in a garage to be in a startup. The concept of entrepreneurship includes anyone who works within my definition of a startup, a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty. That means entrepreneurs are everywhere and the lean startup approach can work in any size company, even a very large enterprise, in any sector or industry. 2. Entrepreneurship is management. A startup is an institution, not just a product, and so it requires a new kind of management specifically geared to its context of extreme uncertainty. In fact, as I will argue later, I believe entrepreneur should be considered a job title in all modern companies that depend on innovation for their future growth. 3. Validated learning. Startups exist not just to make stuff, make money, or even serve customers. They exist to learn how to build a sustainable business. This learning can be validated scientifically by running frequent experiments that allow entrepreneurs to test each element of their vision. 4. Build, measure, learn. The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere. All successful startup processes should be geared to accelerate that feedback loop. 5. Innovation accounting. To improve entrepreneurial outcomes and hold innovators accountable, we need to focus on the boring stuff, how to measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize work. This requires a new kind of accounting designed for startups and the people who hold them accountable. 6. Why startups fail. Why are startups failing so badly everywhere we look? The first problem is the allure of a good plan, a solid strategy, and thorough market research. In earlier eras, these things were indicators of likely success. The overwhelming temptation is to apply them to startups too, but this doesn't work because startups operate with too much uncertainty. Startups do not yet know who their customer is or what their product should be. As the world becomes more uncertain, it gets harder and harder to predict the future. The old management methods are not up to the task. Planning and forecasting are only accurate when based on a long, stable, operating history in a relatively static environment. Startups have neither. The second problem"", ""measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere.

Startups have neither. The second problem is that after seeing traditional management fail to solve this problem, some entrepreneurs and investors have thrown up their hands and adopted the just-do-it school of startups. This school believes that if management is the problem, chaos is the answer. Unfortunately, as I can attest firsthand, this doesn't work either. It may seem counterintuitive to think that something as disruptive, innovative, and chaotic as a startup can be managed or, to be accurate, must be managed. Most people think of process and management as boring and dull, whereas startups are dynamic and exciting. But what is actually exciting is to see startups succeed and change the world. The passion, energy, and vision that people bring to these new ventures are resources too precious to waste. We can, and must, do better. This book is about how. How this book is organized This book is divided into three parts. Vision, Steer, and Accelerate Vision makes the case for a new discipline of entrepreneurial management. I identify who is an entrepreneur, define a startup, and articulate a new way for startups to gauge if they are making progress, called validated learning. To achieve that learning, we'll see that startups, in a garage or inside an enterprise, can use scientific experimentation to discover how to build a sustainable business. Steer dives into the lean startup method in detail, showing one major turn through the core build-measure-learn-feedback loop. Beginning with leap-of-faith assumptions that cry out for rigorous testing, you'll learn how to build a minimum viable product to test those assumptions, a new accounting system for evaluating whether you're making progress, and a method for deciding whether to pivot changing course with one foot anchored to the ground or persevere. In Accelerate, we'll explore techniques that enable lean startups to speed through the build-measure-learn-feedback loop as quickly as possible. We'll explore lean manufacturing concepts that are applicable to startups, too, such as the power of small batches. We'll also discuss organizational design, how products grow, and how to apply lean startup principles beyond the proverbial barrage, even inside the world's largest companies. Management's Second Century As a business, we need to be able to adapt to the changing environment. As a society, we have a proven set of techniques for managing big companies and we know the best practices for building physical products. But when it comes to startups and innovation, we are still shooting in the dark. We are relying on vision, chasing the great men who can make magic happen, or trying to analyze our new products to death. These are new problems, born of the success of management in the 20th century. This book attempts to put entrepreneurship and innovation on a rigorous footing. We are at the dawn of management's second century. It is our challenge to do something great with the opportunity we have been given. The lean startup movement seeks to ensure that those of us who long to build the next big thing will have the tools we need to change the world."", ""shooting in the dark.

What are the three core principles?,"[""Many times, not getting something done is how to appropriately engage with it. Every one of you, hopefully, is appropriately not engaged with every single thing else aside from listening to me right now. So there's some key, there's something unique about being appropriately engaged. Why does a crisis get us there? Because it forces us to do those behaviors that get us there. Now there's a lot to unpack about this idea of appropriate engagement. I'll hit the highlights of it. A few indicators of this would be, think about, are you appropriately engaged right now with the project you're on, with the paper you need to write, with your cat, with the holiday coming towards you? Are you appropriately engaged with your health? Are you appropriately engaged, by the way, with all the stuff you've heard so far today that might be, ooh, I might, would, could, should want to do that? Do you have appropriate engagement with that? An indicator, by the way, that you don't have to go very far to find opportunities to be more appropriately engaged, just notice what's on your mind. Any of you have anything on your mind, aside from listening to me? Any of you have any strategic and important stuff on your mind? Well, interestingly, the more it's on your mind, the more it's not happening. The more you are inappropriately engaged with it. Why? It's not on cruise control. It's only on your mind because you know there's still some thinking or some decisions about that you haven't made or you haven't parked the results of that into some trusted systemic process that you trust will be triggered at the right time in the right way. You actually don't have to finish those things, folks, to be appropriately engaged and get them off your mind. But there are very specific things that you do need to do about that. So there's a number of paradoxes, by the way, that happen about all this material. There's some counterintuitive things about what I'm going to be sharing with you in the next few minutes. You're going to need to get comfortable with that if you want to get to this place of productive engagement without a crisis forcing you to do that. The big paradox is that all the complexities and all the stuff of your life, in order to manage that, you just need three core principles that you understand and apply. It's not about a new smartphone. It's not about a new elegant planner. It's not about a new piece of software. Those are cool tools, but only insofar as you use them to apply those key principles. Once you get those principles, you make your own system. A second paradox here is that the initial moves and behaviors and best practice of this may very likely, for many of you, initially feel very awkward, very unnatural, and even unnecessary. It's exactly like learning moves in the martial art, which I did years ago. If you want to learn how to maximally produce power with a karate punch, you're going to have to spend hundreds of hours doing something that feels very awkward and very unnatural as a movement. Hundreds of hours doing that. Once you do that, by the way, you'll never go back to anything less in terms of producing power. Some of the things I'll be recommending will be just like that. For instance, don't keep anything in your head the rest of your life. That's going to feel unnatural, awkward, and unnecessary. Every single thing you're committed to finish that takes more than one step to finish it, you need to clarify exactly what that outcome and project is and put that on a project list that you look at at least once a week. Every single next action you need to take about any of your commitments that you're involved in, you need to clarify those and park those in appropriate places that you're going to see those actions on a regular basis. That's going to feel awkward, unnatural, and unnecessary. The final paradox of all of this, wrap all that together, is that some very specific but seemingly mundane behaviors, when applied, produce the capacity for you to exist in a kind of sophisticated spontaneity, which, in my experience, is a key element to a successful life. Now, I'm going to reinforce why I think this is critical, what it would look like if you were wildly successful doing this, and I'm going to give you some hows, how to do that. What's the problem? The problem is when you're not in crisis. There's a more subliminal crisis that happens. Why? The whole world now is allowed into your psyche. You now get"", ""those weeds and hung up in them like crazy. And you'll spend a lot of time, you know, doing a lot of trying to get organized about things that may not be that important, right? In the morning, you were a crazy maker, said get a new iPhone. The afternoon, you spend two hours of what could be a strategic afternoon trying to set up the right ringtones. Here's what's true about all three of those, folks. You ain't ready for what's coming towards you. You will be suboptimal in terms of your ability to handle the surprises, and they're coming. Good, bad, or indifferent, they're coming. Trust me. And you want to be optimally available for those things when they come to you. Now everybody says, I'm doing okay. And I doubt if many of you in here will feel motivated enough to go do what I'm talking about because some part of you may not be feeling that it's that bad because you got a job or you're doing fine. You got relationships. You got money. You're doing okay. I'm suggesting, though, for thousands of people who have implemented what I'm sharing with you here, it could be a whole lot better. How sustainable is your life and work style right now in terms of the long haul? How available are you to all kinds of creative things that are right around you right now but you don't have the bandwidth to recognize them or take advantage of them? And it could be a whole lot better. What would better actually look or sound like? Well, let's, you know, I use a metaphor from nature. Nature seems to get a whole lot of stuff done, but it ain't stressed and it ain't worried. You know, there just seems to be sort of a natural rhythm about how things happen here. So if you go back to our matrix and say, look, if I had just the right amount of perspective and just enough structure, just the right amount so that I've got the stability to focus on that and then to execute on it, now you're in the captain commander modality, which, by the way, is very cool because that's the place that you're then going to be able to engage with life and your creativity in what it's designed for, which is using your creative intuitive intelligence, you know, into new frontiers. You're going to much more be in your zone as a normal state as opposed to an exceptional state. And you're going to be a whole lot more capable of dealing with surprise and change as it's coming at you. And by the way, it's coming faster and faster. That's what's new about the world is how frequently everything is, being ready for that. Basically, I refer to it, I use a martial arts term as mind like water. A body of water responds to physical forces around it totally appropriate. It doesn't overreact, doesn't underreact. You throw in a pebble, it does pebble. Back to calm and balanced again. You throw in a boulder, what does it do? It does boulderness. It does it very dispassionately. It doesn't tense up before the rock hits it. It doesn't get all mad at the rock for having disturbed its calm life. Back to calm and balanced again. Now, out of these, you know, metaphors from nature, I've got a couple of lessons I've learned. Lesson number one is, hey, folks, flexibility trumps perfection way, way, way beyond. Life is not static, folks. There is no perfection here. If there is, it means I've now married myself and matched myself to the dynamics of life and its activity. The second lesson I've learned is I need the ability to be able to shift my focus rapidly in, out, up, down quickly. You know, in very few minutes, I might deal with a family issue and then take out the garbage and then be dealing with a business negotiation and not take one to the next but be fully available for each thing, give it its appropriate due. Most people are taking one meeting to the next. Most people are taking home to work and work to home. That's not mind like water. Here's what you're really after. You want the ability to be able to put your focus exactly where you need it, in the way you need it, and not use your mind to be trying to accumulate stuff and avoid it. Big key. Folks, if you don't give appropriate attention to what has your attention, it'll start to take more of your attention than it deserves. So the weird, strange thing here is you actually have to use your mind to get stuff off your"", ""The art of stress-free productivity is a martial art. I'm going to start with a quick little story, 1990, I took an overnight sailing trip with my girlfriend at the time to Santa Cruz Island, it's part of the Channel Islands, about 26 miles off the coast of Santa Barbara. It's a rugged, beautiful island, but the coast is very rugged, sheer cliffs, a lot of rocky outcroppings. We anchored in a tiny little cove, not many of those, we anchored in one, as it was getting dark, we went below to make dinner, and the wind suddenly came up to a howl, as it does in this area, by the way, can pretty easily. As I'm making dinner, I got the queasy feeling our boat was moving. And sure enough, our anchors were losing their grip. That's very uncool, in a tiny little cove, where the wind is howling, and about 50 yards away at the end of the cove, a very nasty sea is brewing. So we ran up top, turned on the motor so we could get some control of the boat, and sure enough, ran over the rear anchor line, which chokes the prop. We now no longer have control of the boat. We are now at the mercy of wind, which is actually whistling down that canyon and blowing us out of the cove, into the open ocean, but then down along that coast, right close to those cliffs. Radioed the Coast Guard, they let us know it would be three hours before their heavy weather rescue boat would get there. So we're pretty much at the mercy of all of this. We got our dinghy ready to go overboard, in case we hit the rocks, boat, and even our lives were at risk. And almost simultaneously, we both looked up at one point and noticed the most incredible, dramatic, beautiful full moon. And amidst all that chaos, we actually had the experience of this wonderful, zen-like peace. I tell you that story because every one of you has something similar, I'm sure, in your history, where you were in something you might in retrospect call a crisis, and somewhere along the line, you found yourself in your zone. Time disappeared. You were fully present. You were totally engaged with what was happening. You were in a productive flow. And if you had the luxury to stop for a minute, you may have then had the experience of a wonderful sense of being present, like my girlfriend and I did that night. See, interestingly, crisis can actually produce a kind of calm that's rare to find sometimes. Why? It demands it. Because it's the calm that comes from those behaviors that create the kind of positive, productive, engaged experience that moves us into our zone, very clear on the outcome for us that was live, instantly making intuitive action decisions and taking actions, being meaningfully engaged toward that outcome. And everything else in our life was put on a back burner so that we'd be totally present about what was happening. And you probably experienced that, too. And maybe you had the sense of that peace. Wouldn't it be nice, by the way, if you could experience that kind of peace, that kind of productive engagement, without having the danger or stress of a crisis force you to? It actually is possible. Let me give you a little secret. Getting things done is not about getting things done. It's really about being appropriately engaged with what's going on. Appropriate engagement is the real key here. Many times, not getting something done is how to appropriately engage with it. Every one of you, hopefully, is appropriately not engaged with every single thing else aside from listening to me right now. So there's some key, there's something unique about being appropriately engaged. Why does a crisis get us there? Because it forces us to do those behaviors that get us there. Now there's a lot to unpack about this idea of appropriate engagement. I'll hit the highlights of it. A few indicators of this would be, think about, are you appropriately engaged right now with the project you're on, with the paper you need to write, with your cat, with the holiday coming towards you? Are you appropriately engaged with your health? Are you appropriately engaged, by the way, with all the stuff you've heard so far today that might be, ooh, I might, would, could, should want to do that? Do you have appropriate engagement with that? An indicator, by the way, that you don't have to go very far to find opportunities to be more appropriately engaged, just notice what's on your mind. Any of you have anything on your mind, aside from listening to""]","The three core principles mentioned in the video are not explicitly listed in the provided chunks.

What places should I visit in Barcelona?,"[""Barcelona which I will recommend you in a few minutes as we get closer to the area. So travelers, let's go to Las Ramblas. El Quim de la Boqueria. I recommend you this place from 1987 if you want to taste authentic market cuisine from La Boqueria Market. Well, if you are lucky enough to get a spot in one of the 16 stools they have. So good luck travelers. Ok travelers, it is time to have lunch and I will recommend you two places that are actually in my top ten list in Barcelona and I will recommend these two places because they are walking distance from where we are which is Las Ramblas. So the first option is called Bar La Plata and this is amazing. I love this place. It is a tiny, local, cozy restaurant that is super old. I will recommend it because if you already have brunch then maybe you are not too hungry because they only sell four dishes. It is great. Just check it out. This is really good. You can try this crazy thing that we do in Catalunya which is this wine that you have to drink it from the bottle like this. You can go and have fun there and if not you can go to Can Julietas which is not only the oldest restaurant in Barcelona but in Catalunya and they make traditional Catalan homemade food. Those dishes are very consistent. Or if not you can go and check Bar La Plata and just have vermouth there and then you can go to Can Julietas to have proper lunch. We are going to try paella in Barceloneta near the beach later. So let's go guys and then we continue with our one day in Barcelona. Ok travelers, after having proper lunch in Barcelona we have energy now to walk all along the Mediterranean Sea. This is a super pleasant walk. We will start from here, from the Ramblas. We have to go till the end of it where the Christopher Columbus monument which I have already visited so if you want to check the best views in town just check my video here and from there we can go towards Rambla de Mar which is the continuation of the Ramblas but above the sea where we have a shopping center called Mare Magnum, the only shopping center that opens on Sundays. If you are here on a Sunday and you want to do shopping you have to go to this place and from there we can walk towards Barceloneta through the old port of Barcelona and then we can continue the walk towards the Vila Olímpica. Beautiful old walk in Barcelona. Let's go. Ok travelers, here we are in the old port of Barcelona and from here we still have a long walk towards Barceloneta beach, the most famous and crowded beach in Barcelona. What to do in this area? Well of course walk all along the old port of Barcelona where we have the big yachts and all the glamour and also in this area we have the Museum of History of Catalunya and you can go to this secret rooftop. You can take the elevator, this is for free, you can go to the fourth floor and you can enjoy amazing panoramic views of the old port, W Hotel and the Montjuic Mountain, this is amazing and you can even grab a cocktail there and just below you have amazing restaurants for paella like Calpincho or Merendera de la Mari. So guys, let's go to Barceloneta. Ok travelers, here we are in Barceloneta beach and from here you can take two different directions like for instance going over there where the W Hotel, it is really cool because it has a viewpoint all around so it's worth it to go there and after that you can go towards the other direction to the Olímpic Vila. So if you want to stay in this area and you want to walk along the beach towards these two places you're gonna need one or two more hours. If this is winter I think after this you will call it a day because you will be tired and it will start getting dark but since it is summer you can still do one more thing, it's far away but we have the bus right in front of here, the B19 bus that goes all the way towards Parc Güell. Parc Güell is a Gaudi gem, it's the same architect who did Sagrada Familia, Casa Milà, Casa Batlló. Is it worth it? Yes, of course, it's absolutely worth it but only if you're not too tired, if not just leave it for a second visit to Barcelona but if you still"", ""Casa Bandió or we can take the bus because I'm really tired. Sorry guys, the bus is coming. This avenue is also a must see in Barcelona, especially with only one day in the city. There are two famous Gaudi houses here so it's really worth it, Gaudi is the most famous architect in Barcelona in case you didn't know about it, so due to the fact that in the old times only the rich people of Barcelona used to live in this area, nowadays Passeig de Gràcia is a luxury shopping area with super top modernist houses such as Casa Milà, La Pedrera and Casa Bandió. Ok travellers, so here we are in Casa Bandió. In case you want to know what it's like in the inside, you can click my video, I have already been here and you have in the description of my video the link to buy the tickets online in advance for the very same price you will be just collaborating with my channel. Also you have in the description of the video the link from La Pedrera video, the other house in case you can't decide which one to go, well guys you have the two of them. The visit in each place takes around two hours. So now we will head towards Rambla, the most crowded street in Barcelona, a must see when you visit Barcelona for just one day. But before going there and before stumbling upon Plaza Catalunya, we will make just a quick stop in my favourite coffee shop in Barcelona, Casa Batlló, which is actually the next house right next to Casa Batlló. This is a modernist beautiful house and we are going to have an amazing chocolate there. Let's go! Let's go! Ok travelers, finally we are here in the nerve center of Barcelona, Plaza Catalunya, so this means we have just made a circle around the city. We started from the old city, then we went to the city of the park, the Art de Triomf, we took metro to Sagrada Familia, then we took the bus towards Casa Milà La Pedrera and Casa Batlló. Of course you can do everything by foot but if you help yourself with the metro and the bus you won't get too tired for only one day in the city. And finally we stopped here. For sure you will come across this square at a certain point of your one day in the city because everything is right next to this square so you cannot get lost. And also from here we have the aerobus, the bus that comes and goes from and to the airport. So now guys, if you have brunch maybe you are not hungry right now but if you had a light breakfast maybe you are. So if you want to have lunch in the city I can recommend you something. We can go from here to Las Ramblas. Las Ramblas is the most touristic, crowded pedestrian street in Barcelona, for sure you have to visit it, it's a must see. So we can go there because there we have the Boqueria Market, the most famous market in the city. I have already done a video about it in case you want to check it out. Do not expect to sit there properly to have lunch because this is super crowded unless you go early but I can recommend you one place in case you are early for this. If not, we can grab something on the go and have proper lunch in a local restaurant in Barcelona which I will recommend you in a few minutes as we get closer to the area. So travelers, let's go to Las Ramblas. El Quim de la Boqueria. I recommend you this place from 1987 if you want to taste authentic market cuisine from La Boqueria Market. Well, if you are lucky enough to get a spot in one of the 16 stools they have. So good luck travelers. Ok travelers, it is time to have lunch and I will recommend you two places that are actually in my top ten list in Barcelona and I will recommend these two places because they are walking distance from where we are which is Las Ramblas.

If I were you, I would start the day early in the morning, like 8am, considering you only have one day in the city and we have to make the most out of it. I would start the day in the old city of Barcelona, the most crowded place, the most touristic one, and I would come early to get the best pictures without any people in the background. I will show you on the map exactly where the Gothic Quarter is, we are right next to the Cathedral of Barcelona, walking distance from Plaza Catalunya, so my recommendation is that you stay in the nearby of Plaza Catalunya, the center of the city, because this is walking distance from everything, so to start the day here in the old quarter, in the old city of Barcelona is the best thing you can do and also from Plaza Catalunya we have the aerobús, the bus that comes and goes to and from the airport, so this place makes sense for you. The old city of Barcelona, the Gothic Quarter is a labyrinth, so get lost, use Google Maps, help yourself, enjoy the cities, the alleys, the hidden corners, this place is amazing. If you want to get the best images of you in Barcelona with anybody, any tourist in the background, come on, join me, let's go. For our Instagram photoshoot tour we will visit the most Instagrammable spots in the city, we will start of the day at the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona plus the secret corners that we personally pick, the Citadella Fountain, the Arc de Triomphe and finally Sagrada Familia, the icon of the city, it's like a walking tour where you learn about history plus a photoshoot tour, all together with the local, what else do you want from me? Rather if you are coming with us or on your own, at around 11 am you could have seen half Barcelona more or less with this itinerary, so now it's time for Sagrada Familia and brunch. Like I say in all my videos, Sagrada Familia is the must-see monument in Barcelona, so you can't leave the city without visiting Sagrada Familia, it has two facades, this is the old one and on the other side we have the new one and you can buy the tickets online to get inside the Basilica and also add the visits to the towers, so more or less you will spend two hours if you go inside, up to you if you want to enter or not, of course I would definitely recommend it and this is the perfect time like around 11 am, 12 to enjoy the beautiful rays of light inside, so I'm super hungry, it is time for me for brunch. Brunch and take is one of the first and most popular brunch places in Barcelona, they offer big portions and healthy dishes and I picked this one because it is in Sagrada Familia very convenient for this itinerary. And Bristol Café, also one of my favourites, they offer amazing sweet bakery and also savoury dishes such as the Benedict X which are amazing. So now travellers, let's walk towards Passeig de Gràcia where we have Casa Milà, La Pedrera and Casa Bandió or we can take the bus because I'm really tired. Sorry guys, the bus is coming. This avenue is also a must see in Barcelona, especially with only one day in the city.

Also guys, if you want to know how to plan your visit to Parc Güell just watch my video here and also in the description of this video. Like for instance my video What are the best beaches in Barcelona? Ok travelers, hope you have enjoyed my video regarding the best things to do with only one day in Barcelona. I think we can call it a day, we are so exhausted, we have walked all along Barcelona and we are here on the beach so if you are too tired just enjoy the beach for the rest of the afternoon or go to a Chiringuito, this bar right at the beach and try a cocktail and some tapas. If you want to have dinner I will recommend you the best restaurants in Barceloneta. Like for instance we have Vaso d'Oro which is a very tiny, local, cozy restaurant in Barcelona for tapas. You can see in the menu they have a star with the top dishes they have. Also we have La Maison de Barceloneta in case you want to try paella. They have black paella, Valencian paella, vegetarian paella, all types of paella. I am sure you are going to find the best paella for you there. Also I will recommend you La Peninsular which is a very local, cozy, fancy restaurant here in Barceloneta where they have one of the best bombas. I have tried in this neighborhood and they also have a lot of tapas and fried fish. And finally travelers, two classics. We have La Coba Fumada, they also have bomba and they have many tapas like fried fish, tapas and whatever. That one is a classic from Barceloneta. And right in front we have Bar La Electricidad which is also super old and they have amazing fresh tapas. So guys, I hope you have enjoyed my video regarding one day in Barcelona. Keep watching two days in Barcelona video. It will be here. So see you next week travelers.

What is a RAG?,"[""an augmented knowledge. So for your company, the AI assistant is given details about your company's documents that are real, up-to-date, and private dataset. All of this can occur without needing to fine-tune the AI model and modify the large language model. The final step of RAG is generation. This step is where AI assistant generates the response given the semantic relevant data retrieved from the vector database. And we have an upcoming video on vector database soon, so make sure to subscribe to be notified when the video is out. So the initial prompt that says, can you tell me about last year's service agreement with CodeCloud? The AI assistant will now demonstrate its understanding of your company's knowledge base by using the documents that relate to service agreements in CodeCloud. And since the initial prompt specifies the criteria of last year, the generation step will use its own reasoning to wrestle with the data that was provided to get the best answer for the question. Now, RAG is a very powerful system that can instantly improve the depth of knowledge beyond its training data. But just like any other system, learning how to calibrate is an acquired skill that needs to be learned to get better result. For example, knowing how to chunk your data before storing them into the vector database is a critical decision that will determine the efficacy of RAG. In order to set up a RAG system, you have to employ different strategies like chunking strategy, where you determine the size and overlap of each chunk, embedding strategy to decide which embedding model to use and to convert your documents into vector embeddings, and retrieval strategy, where you control the threshold of how similar the words need to be as well as additional filters that you might want to add in the data set. Setting up a RAG system will look different from one system to another because it heavily depends on the data set that you're trying to store. For example, legal documents will require a different chunking strategy than, say, customer support transcript document. This is because legal documents often have long structured paragraphs that need to be preserved, while conversational transcript can be just fine with sentence level chunking with high overlap to preserve context. Now that we covered the conceptual elements of RAG, let's look at how it looks like on a practical level. To better understand this, we can look over at this lab specifically geared towards how to use RAG. When I open the lab, I'm dropped right into a real-world mission. 500 gigabytes of company dogs need to be turned into instant, accurate answers through a RAG system. Access the labs using the link in the description below and follow along with me. In the first question, we're asked to set up a development environment. I created a Python virtual environment, activated, install uv, and then pull in chroma db, sentence transformers, openai, and flask. A tiny marker that says ready confirms that I'm set. The tests check vmd exist, uv is available, all four packages are installed, nice and clean. In the next question, we're asked to review tech corps document vault. I skim the simulated repo of markdown docs, employee handbook, product specs, meeting notes, and frequently asked questions. The key takeaway is that we'll treat these like a real enterprise corpus and make them searchable by meeting, not just keywords. Explore this question by yourself to get a real feel for the data set. In the following question, we're asked to initialize our vector database. I spin up chroma db locally using a persistent client and create a collection named tech corps underscore docs. The test verifies a chroma underscore db directory exists and the initialization script is present. This is our AI brain storage. In the next question, we're asked to learn the chunking strategy. I write a small script that chunks text with a size 500 and overlap 100. This preserved context across boundaries and improve retrieval quality. It prints chunk stats and writes a verification file with a chunk count. The test checks the script exists and output file is valid. Chunking is critical for accuracy. In the next question, we're asked to understand embedding. I load all mini lm l6 v2 from sentence transformers, encode a few short sentences, and compute similarities. The test checks that a result file exists and contains similarity values. The big idea here is that questions and documents both become vectors so we can measure meaning, not just words. So dogs allowed and pets permitted have a high similarity. However, remote work does not have similarity. In the next question, we're asked to feed the AI brain. This is where it comes together. I iterate"", ""So your company has 500 gigabytes of documents in their server, and you are asked to connect an AI assistant just like ChatJPT to answer questions about these documents. And you think to yourself, man, how am I supposed to get this done? From your experience, you know that typical chat applications can't accept more than a dozen files. So you have to use a different method to allow the AI to search, read, and understand the entire files. But how? Maybe you think you can create a clever algorithm to search the title of the documents and its contents to rank them by relevance. But you soon realize that that means that every time the user searches, it would need to search the entire 500 gigabytes of documents, and this is a very inefficient way to get it done. So maybe you try to do something else by doing some pre-processing work before so that preemptively you summarize all documents into searchable chunks. But you also realize in this case that it's not likely going to be an accurate way to get things done. Let's try a different method. Why don't we try to merge these two ideas together and get the best of both worlds? Starting with the large language model, we know that the core idea behind how LLMs actually take an input is word embedding, meaning human language is turned into numerical representation because computers can't think in words but in numbers. So is it possible that instead of searching through the entire 500 gigabytes of documents, we essentially store these documents by preserving the semantics, which means meaning of those words, into a vector embedding and store those into a database as vectors. And if we can do that, maybe we can retrieve these faster by splitting the context into chunks in the vector database so that AI assistants can fit them into their context window and generate output from it. This method is called RAG or Retrieval Augmented Generation. Let's say one of the use cases for the company to use the AI assistant was to ask questions like, can you tell me about last year's service agreement with CodeCloud? In order to understand how RAG works, we need to break them down into three different steps, retrieval, augmented, and generation. Starting with retrieval, just like how we converted the documents into vector embeddings to store them into the database, we do the exact same step for the question that reads, can you tell me about last year's service agreement with CodeCloud? Once the word embedding for the question is generated, the embedding for the question is compared against the embedding of the documents. This type of search is called semantic search, where instead of searching by static keywords to find relevant contents based on its matching, the meaning and the context of the query is used to match against the existing document. Moving on to augmentation. Augmentation in RAG refers to the process where the retrieved data is injected into the prompt at runtime. And you might think, why is this all that special? Typically, AI assistants rely on what they learn during pre-training, which is static knowledge that can become outdated really fast. Instead, our goal here is to have the AI assistant rely on up-to-date information in the vector database. So on runtime, we need to be able to provide the AI assistant with important details that could help answer the question like above. In the case of RAG, the semantic search result pens to the prompt that essentially serves as an augmented knowledge. So for your company, the AI assistant is given details about your company's documents that are real, up-to-date, and private dataset. All of this can occur without needing to fine-tune the AI model and modify the large language model. The final step of RAG is generation. This step is where AI assistant generates the response given the semantic relevant data retrieved from the vector database. And we have an upcoming video on vector database soon, so make sure to subscribe to be notified when the video is out.

The test checks that a result file exists and contains similarity values. The big idea here is that questions and documents both become vectors so we can measure meaning, not just words. So dogs allowed and pets permitted have a high similarity. However, remote work does not have similarity. In the next question, we're asked to feed the AI brain. This is where it comes together. I iterate through tech corps documents, chunking file, size 500, strike 400, embed each chunk with all mini lm l6 v2, and store vectors plus metadata into the tech corp underscore docs collection. It logs per file progress and writes a summary. Documents are processed and total chunks. The test confirms the ingest script exists, the completion file is created, and the format is valid. This is our knowledge ingestion pipeline. In the next question, we're asked to activate semantic search. I build a tiny search engine script, load the collection, embed three ceo style queries, and fetch top results by semantic similarity. It writes results to a file, prints structured output, the test ensure the script exists, the result files exist, and all three queries ran. Explore this question by yourself to read the results and see how well meaning-based search works. In the following question, we're asked to launch a simple web interface. I ask a flask app port 5000, then run a running marker. We're asked to test like the ceo. I open the app and try questions such as what's the pet policy? I watch the rag flow, retrieve, augment, generate with sources. Then I mark the test as tested. This is where demo value shines. Answers grounded in our private docs. With retrieval plus augmentation plus generation in place, we're ready for a UI to ask questions. We've got an end-to-end rag system that's fast, grounded, and extensible. A few things I've paid special attention to along this way. The model is all-mini-lml6v2, which is compact and effective. For chunking, size 500 with overlap 400 for test, stride 400 in ingestion. Both preserve context for better recall. For storage, chroma db persists client with documents techcorps underscore docs. For web, simple flask app on port 5000 for quick evaluation. For safety, similarity threshold keeps low quality matches out, reducing hallucination. Before wrapping up, explore these questions by yourself and notice how retrieval, quality, and answer helpfulness change with small tuning. That's it. We went from zero to working rag system backed by real tests, clean structure, and a demo interface. Go and try it yourself.""]","RAG, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, is a method that combines retrieval and generation to enhance the capabilities of AI assistants. It involves three main steps: retrieval, where documents are converted into vector embeddings for semantic search; augmentation, where relevant data is injected into the AI's prompt at runtime; and generation, where the AI produces responses based on the retrieved information. This approach allows the AI to provide up-to-date and contextually relevant answers without needing to fine-tune the underlying model. RAG improves the depth of knowledge beyond the AI's initial training data by leveraging a private dataset stored in a vector database.","RAG, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, is a method that combines retrieval and generation processes to enhance the capabilities of AI assistants.

What is the advantage of a vector database?,"[""Let's say your company has an employee handbook that covers policies like time off requests, dress code, and equipment use. Employees might ask questions like, can I wear jeans in the office? Or can I request time off on a holiday? Or can I bring my company laptop home for the weekend? While these are common questions that people would typically ask, building a database around this requirement can be a little bit tricky. In a conventional approach where data is stored in a structured database like SQL, you typically need to do some amount of similarity search like select all from documents where content like holiday or time off with the n% around it. And to expand your result set, you might even increase the scope by dropping a few characters like this and removing spaces between time and off like this. However, the drawback to this approach is that it puts the onus on the person searching for the data to get the search term formatted correctly. But what if there was a different way to store the data? What if instead of storing them by the value, we store the meaning of the words? This way, when you search the database by sending the question itself, can I request a time off on a holiday instead of the SQL query? So based on the meaning of the words containing the question, the database returns only relevant data back. This is a spirit of what vector databases try to address, storing data by the embedding. So essentially, instead of searching by value, we can now search by meaning. While conceptually, this might seem a little bit straightforward, there's a bit of an overhead in setting this up. And you might be asking, well, can we just throw the employee handbook document into the database like we would in SQL database? Not quite. And here's why. With SQL databases, the burden is actually put on the user searching for the data that's stored in the structured database. But with vector databases, the burden is put on you, who is actually setting up the database since you are trying to make it easier for someone searching for the data that's inside it. And you can imagine why a method like this is becoming extremely popular when paired with the large language models in AI, since you don't have to train the LLM separately on how to actually search your database. Instead, the LLM can freely search based on meaning and have the confidence that your database will return relevant data that it needs. So let's explore some of the key concepts behind what goes into setting up a basic vector database. Let's start with the embedding. Embedding is really the key concept that makes the medium go from value to meaning. In SQL, we stored the values contained in the employee handbook as a straight up value. But in vector databases, you need to do a little bit of extra work upfront to convert the value into its semantic meanings. And these meanings are stored in what's called an embedding. For example, the words holiday and vacation should semantically share a similar space since the meaning of those words are close to each other. So before the sentences like employees shall not request time off on holidays that's stored in the document is added to the database, the system runs it through an embedding model. The embedding model converts the sentence into a long vector of numbers. And when you search the database, you're actually comparing this exact vector. That way, when someone later asks, can I take a vacation during a holiday, even though the phrasing is different, the database can still service the request. This is the fundamental shift. Instead of searching by exact wording, we're now searching by meaning. Another important concept is dimensionality. And you might be asking, why do I have to worry about dimensionality? Can't I just throw the words into an embedding and store them into the database? Well, there's one more aspect in embedding that you need to think about. That's dimensionality. Typically, a word doesn't just have one meaning to learn from. For example, the word vacation can have different semantics depending on the context that it is used. And capturing all the intricacies like tone, formality, and other features that give richness to the words are important. The total dimensions that we use today are 1,536 dimensions, which gives a good mix of not having too much storage burden in size, but also giving enough context to allow for depth in each search. So once the embedding is stored with the proper dimension, there are two other major angles that we need to consider when we are working with vector"", ""way, when someone later asks, can I take a vacation during a holiday, even though the phrasing is different, the database can still service the request.

So once the embedding is stored with the proper dimension, there are two other major angles that we need to consider when we are working with vector databases. And this is the retrieval side, meaning now that we stored the meaning of those words, we have to take on the burden of the retrieval of these embeddings. Since we are not doing searches like we did in SQL, we need to make a decision on what would technically be counted as a match semantically and by how much. This is done by looking at scoring and chunk overlap. And if you're wondering at this point, this just seems like a lot of tweaking just to use a vector database. And that's the serious trade-off that you ought to consider when using a vector database, which is that while a properly set up vector database makes searching so much more flexible, getting the data stored and retrieved often adds complexity. So with that in mind, scoring is a threshold that you set to how similar the results need to be to be considered a proper match. For example, the word Florida might have some similarity to the word vacation, since it's often where people go for vacation. But asking the question, can I take my company laptop to Florida is very different than does my company allow vacation to Florida, since one is asking about a policy on IT jurisdiction and the other about the vacation policy. So setting a score threshold based on the question can help limit low similarities to count as a match. Okay, there's one final angle, which is the chunk overlap. So in SQL, we're used to storing things row by row, but in a vector database, things look slightly different. When we're storing values in vector database, they're often chunked going into the database. So when we chunk down an employee handbook into chunks, it's possible that the meaning gets chunked with it. That's why we allow chunk overlap so that the context spills over to leave enough margin for the search to work properly. Popular implementation of vector databases include Pinecone and ChromaDB. And these platforms are designed to handle embeddings at scale and provide efficient retrieval based on semantic similarity. And these are also great tools to use for prototyping something really quick. So now that we have these concepts understood, we can actually take on the burden of making search easier for users and taking on the burden ourselves to set up a vector database for the company to use it for employee handbooks and many more documents that we need. All right, let's start with the labs. In these series of labs, we're going to explore how vector databases solve one of the most fundamental problems in information retrieval, the semantic gap between how humans ask questions and how computers store information. While traditional SQL databases require exact keyword matches, vector databases understand making them the backbone of modern AI applications. Let's start by setting up our environment. In this first section, we're asked to run a simple setup script that installs NumPy for vector mathematics, Sentence Transformers for real AI embeddings, and ChromaDB for our production vector database. Once you've activated the virtual environment, we'll jump into lab one. In this demonstration, you'll create a real SQLite database containing company policies, the dress code, time off rules, and remote work guidelines. When an employee asks, what are the clothing rules, you'll watch the SQLite operator search for clothing in the policies. The result? Nothing. Zero matches. The policy says dress code, not clothing. And SQL doesn't understand these terms are related. Each query pauses to let you see the failure happen in real time. By the end,"", ""use it for employee handbooks and many more documents that we need. All right, let's start with the labs.

And SQL doesn't understand these terms are related. Each query pauses to let you see the failure happen in real time. By the end, you're looking at a 0% success rate. Three reasonable questions, but three complete failures. Moving on to lab two, we encounter the magic of embeddings. In this question, we're asked to understand how the AllMiniLM L6v2 model, with its 22 million parameters, transformed words into 384 dimensional vectors. Here's where things get fascinating. You'll start by comparing word pairs that mean the same thing, but share no common letters. The lab loads a real AI model and shows you how holiday and vacation, completely different words, produce vectors that are 87% similar. You'll see the actual numbers, watching as the model converts each word into a list of 384 floating point values. The lab then explores why we need so many dimensions. Just like describing a person requires more than just their height, capturing their meaning of texts require hundreds of dimensions. One dimension might capture formality, another the topic, another the sentiment. With 384 dimensions, the model captures incredibly nuanced semantic relationships. The interactive section here lets you type any two texts and see their similarity score in real-time. Lab three takes us into similarity search, where we build our own vector database from scratch. In this demonstration, you'll implement cosine similarity and see how it enables semantic search that actually works. The real magic happens when you test natural language queries. Can I wear jeans to work? Doesn't contain the words dress or code, yet it correctly matches the dress code policy. The lab visualizes similarity scores as progress bars, making it easy to see which policies are most relevant. One of the most enlightening sections is the Florida example. When you ask, can I take my company laptop to Florida? It matches the remote work policy because it understands that this is about equipment. But can I use vacation days for Florida trip? Matches the time off policy because it recognizes this is about vacation. So the same word Florida, completely different context, correctly identified. The scoring threshold section is crucial for production systems. You'll experiment with different values, 0.7 for high confidence, 0.5 for moderate matches, 0.3 for weak associations. Setting the threshold too high means missing relevant results, while too low introduces noise. Our final lab, lab four, brings everything together with ChromaDB, a production-ready vector database used by company worldwide. In this demonstration, you're building TIA's complete smart handbook system that can answer any employee question naturally. You'll start by initializing ChromaDB with persistence and load comprehensive policy documents. You'll see queries like, can I wear jeans on Monday? Correctly matching the dress code policy with accurate answer that jeans are only allowed on Fridays. What makes this lab particularly valuable is the document chunking demonstration. You'll see why overlap matters when splitting long documents. The lab shows how carelessly splitting text can break words in half. Imagine splitting the word vacation into vacay and chun across chunks. The meaning is completely lost. With proper overlap, split the sentence boundaries first, then combine sentences to reach target chunk size. Never split in the middle of words, so preserving semantic coherence. With this, we have come to the end of the lab, where you've seen SQL fail with natural language, watched AI transform text into meaningful vectors, implemented similarity search from scratch and deployed a production-ready system with ChromaDB. The key insight is that vector databases aren't just about better search, they're about bridging the semantic gap between human language and computer storage."", ""employee question naturally.

When did the speaker work with Steve Jobs?,"[""measure uniqueness. On the horizontal axis, we measure value. This is a two-by-two matrix. If any of you go on to work for McKinsey, you will learn that in a two-by-two matrix, you always want the upper right-hand corner. McKinsey will charge you $25,000 for that. So let's discuss all four corners. The bottom right corner is where you create something of value, but it's not unique. There you have to compete on price. Slam operating system on the same hardware, you have to compete on price. The opposite corner, in the opposite corner, you have something truly unique, only you do it, but it is of no value. In that corner, you're just plain stupid. In the bottom left corner, that's what I call the dot-com corner, because there you have a company like pets.com that does something that is of no value and stupid people like me funded 10 other clones of pets.com. So it has no value and it's not unique. That's the worst corner of all. But the corner you want to be in, the holy grail of marketing, the holy grail of entrepreneurship, the holy grail of innovation, the holy grail of making meaning in the world is the upper right-hand corner. Create something that's unique and truly valuable. Macintosh was unique and truly valuable. There are other things. This is the Breitling emergency watch. This watch, if you pull out the antenna, puts out an emergency signal. So you don't do this when you just take the wrong exit. You do this when you're about to die, okay? Because if you do this, there'll be a Coast Guard helicopter looking for you and Kevin Costner's going to be in that helicopter, okay? But this is a watch that can save your life. Not many watches can save your life. This watch is unique and valuable. The key to all of marketing, all of innovation is you need to be in that upper right-hand corner. Make something unique and valuable. And this is my last slide. And my last slide is to tell you that one of the most valuable lessons that I learned from Steve is that in life, some things need to be believed to be seen. Usually you hear this the opposite way, that in order for you to believe something, you have to see it. But I will tell you, when it comes to changing the world, what I learned from Steve Jobs is if you believe in a Macintosh, if you believe in iPhone, iPod, iPad, if you believe enough, then you will see it because other people will believe in it. Other people will create software. Other people will create products. So you need to foster the belief in what you are dreaming so that it becomes a reality, which is very different than saying, I don't expect anybody to believe it until I see it. You need people to believe it before they can see it. And then I'd like to wrap up. You know, I consider it an honor to have worked for Steve Jobs. It wasn't easy. It wasn't easy, but it was an honor. And I can tell you right now, in heaven, Steve Jobs is telling God what to do. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you."", ""to pitching. Just do this, and you'll be better than 90% of the people using PowerPoint. I'll show you a great, great Steve Jobs slide. This is Steve Jobs slide at its best. Huge Windows logo. Huge logo. iTunes. 150-point font. The best Windows app ever written. Steve Jobs with this slide is proclaiming that Apple has written the best Windows app. He's using a huge logo, huge font. Count how many words are on that slide. iTunes. The best Windows app ever written. Like seven words. The key to a great PowerPoint presentation, big font, big graphics. If you use a small font and you read your small font, what happens is the audience, one slide into your presentation, figures out this bozo is reading his slides verbatim. I can read the slides to myself faster than this bozo can read them to me. So why don't I just read ahead? And you lose your audience. If you want a, I realize this is a heavy engineering crowd, I'll give you an algorithm. The algorithm is figure out who the oldest person is in the audience, divide his or her age by two. If you're talking to 60-year-old people, divide by two, 30 points. 50-year-old people, divide by two, 25 points. Someday you may be pitching a 16-year-old venture capitalist. God bless you. That day, use the eight-point font, okay? But until that day, big font, big graphic. Number seven, changing your mind is a sign of intelligence. Many people believe that changing your mind is a sign of stupidity. Because you got it wrong. And you don't want to admit that you're wrong. You want to hide the fact that you're wrong. You don't want to hold it out that you had to change your mind. Steve Jobs taught me exactly the opposite. This is a press release from June 11th, 2007. This is when iPhone was introduced. Our innovative approach, using web 2.0-based standards, lets developers create amazing new applications while keeping the iPhone secure and reliable. June 11th, 2007, the introduction of the iPhone. Steve Jobs is telling you why there can be no third-party apps for an iPhone. If you want to do something that adds functionality to an iPhone, you have to have a Safari plugin. It's because we're doing you a favor. We want you to have a phone that is secure and reliable. One could logically ask at that point, well, Steve, why do you say that the phone has to be secure and reliable, but the computer doesn't? Why is it that there are third-party apps for the computer? Never mind. Don't ask. A year later, Apple press release. Apple executives to showcase Mac OS X Leopard and OS X iPhone development platforms at Worldwide Developers Conference 2008 keynote. One year later, Steve Jobs has gone from, we are going to allow no third-party apps for the iPhone, to we now have an iPhone development platform, may there be many, many different kind of apps, ranging from measuring your heart rate to eye fart, whatever it takes, right? This is a 180-degree reversal. Steve Jobs said closed system. Steve Jobs said open system, 12 months later. Keeping your mind is a sign of intelligence. And just FYI, when Steve Jobs in 2007 said that the iPhone had to be closed so that you would have a secure and safe phone, all the experts said, my God, Steve is right. You have to have a really secure and protected phone. 12 months later, Steve opens up the phone, and guess what the experts say? My God, Steve is right. You want an open system so you can have an app for that. Number eight, value is not equal to price. There's a difference here. Macintosh, iPhone, iPod, any of those things, anything, is not the cheapest. But arguably, it is the highest value. This is a screenshot from an ad where the Windows guy had to run a bake sale to get money to support the bugs in Windows NT. The Macintosh guy doesn't have to do that because there are less bugs. Effectively, it's saying that, yes, a Macintosh may cost more at the front end, but when you consider training and support and debugging, it is a better value. Price is different from value. Try to never fight on price. Number nine, A players hire A plus players. That is, a good person hires a better person, not a lesser person. What you'll see is that B players, because of their insecurity, like to hire C players. They want to feel better than the person they hired. The problem is when a B player hires a C player, it creates this downward spiral, and the C player hires the D"", ""Thank you very much, good morning people of San Diego, go Tritons, it's a real pleasure to be here, thank you, thank you. So I am going to talk to you today about what I learned from Steve Jobs. I worked for Steve Jobs kind of twice in my life, the first time from 1983 to 1987 in the Mac division, which was the largest collection of egomaniacs in the history of Silicon Valley, and that's saying a lot if you know people from Silicon Valley. The second time was right after the 1997-1998 time frame, and so I had two tours of duty with Steve. I will tell you that he was just the greatest influence in my life, I would not be where I am without him. The world is a lot less interesting place without Steve Jobs, there is no question about that. And so I've seen many books and many things written about Steve Jobs, and I took it upon myself to write from a first person, person who was inside the reality distortion field, what I learned from Steve Jobs. I usually use a top 10 format, but Steve Jobs cannot be limited with these usual rules, I actually have a top 12 format today. And so I'm going to pass along everything that I learned from Steve Jobs so that you may apply it to your lives, your businesses, your studies, so that you may in fact change the world, because one of the things that Steve Jobs certainly did was change the world. So may he rest in peace, but may his influence continue to inspire us. So number one thing that I learned from Steve Jobs is that experts are usually clueless, they will tell you something can't be done, shouldn't be done, and isn't necessary. Many, many people in the 1983 time frame told Apple, build a bigger, faster, cheaper Apple 2. Don't do anything silly like get to the next curve. Experts are clueless, not one of them should be believed. As a young person in particular, do not listen to the experts. Listen to your heart, go for it. When you encounter naysaying, go against the naysaying. You know, this is what I call a bozosity. You know, bozosity is like the flu. You have to inoculate yourself so that when you encounter bozosity, you will already have built up resistance. I'm going to give you three examples of bozosity, so you build up the antigens to the bozosity. First bozosity, I think there's a world market for maybe five computers. The chairman of IBM allegedly said there's five computers in the world, I have five computers in my house. I have all the computers he anticipated in the world in my house. This telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us, Western Union, 1876. In 1876, Western Union wrote off telephony, oops. Western Union should be PayPal today. But it's hard to go from telegraph to computer to internet if you skip telephone in the middle. It's too big a chasm to cross. There's no reason why anyone would want a computer in their home. Ken Olson, founder of DECK, great entrepreneur, great innovator. He was so successful on the mini-computer curve, he could not embrace the personal computer curve. Number one, experts are usually clueless. Number two, customers cannot tell you what they want. Customers will tell you they want better, faster, cheaper Apple II, better, faster, cheaper status quo, better, faster, cheaper of what you already make. Nobody asked Apple for 128K Macintosh with no software thanks to my efforts, 400K floppy, 128K of RAM. Nobody asked them. They wanted better, faster, cheaper Apple II. Customers usually cannot tell you what they want. You have to have your vision, your passion. You need to jump ahead of them. The way to jump ahead of them is to get to the next curve, the next thing that I learned from Steve Jobs. The action, the true action, the great innovation in the world doesn't occur on the curve you are on. It occurs on the next curve. Ice 1.0, Bubba and Junior would go to a frozen lake or a frozen pond and cut blocks of ice in the 1900s. Seven million pounds of ice was harvested in 1900. The technology at that point was horse, saw, sleigh. Frozen lake, frozen pond, cold time of the year, go out to the lake, cut the ice, ice 1.0. Thirty years later, ice 2.0, ice factory. Now you froze water centrally. Big technological change. Now it didn't have to be winter. You didn't have to be in a cold city. You could have an"", ""cheaper of what you already make.

Now the ice man didn't have to deliver ice to your house. You didn't have to go to the ice factory to get your ice. You had your own personal ice factory in your house called a refrigerator, a PC if you will, a personal chiller. The very interesting fact is that none of the ice harvesters became ice factories and none of the ice factories became refrigerator companies. And why is that? It's because most organizations define themselves in terms of what they already do. We cut blocks of ice in the winter. We freeze water centrally. We make a device called a refrigerator. You need to step back from what you currently do and look at the benefits you provide your customers, your clients. The ice business is fundamentally in the business of convenience and cleanliness. And it can be done by harvesting ice, but it can be done by freezing ice centrally. And it can be done with your personal ice factory. Concentrate on the benefits, not the processes of your organization. The fourth thing I learned from Steve Jobs is the big challenges beget the biggest accomplishments. Give people what Tom Peters called the big, hairy, audacious goals. When IBM came into the computer business, Apple ran this ad. We welcomed IBM to the computer business because we wanted to take on the biggest, the most impressive, the most dominant company. Welcome IBM. Seriously. It was a huge goal. Steve told us, we want to defeat IBM. We want to send IBM back to the typewriter business holding its electric balls. The biggest challenge beget the biggest accomplishments. Number five, design counts. Don't let people tell you that design doesn't count. People care about thinness and beautifulness and aluminum, not black, ugly, plastic laptops. How many of you use a big, black, thick, ugly laptop? Hold your hands up. Yeah. You are oppressed because nobody voluntarily uses a big, thick, black, ugly laptop. I feel bad for you. I feel bad for you. You could have something cool and thin and beautiful. Enough people in the world care about design. Design counts. Number six, use big graphics and big fonts. This is the key to pitching. Just do this, and you'll be better than 90% of the people using PowerPoint. I'll show you a great, great Steve Jobs slide. This is Steve Jobs slide at its best. Huge Windows logo. Huge logo. iTunes. 150-point font. The best Windows app ever written. Steve Jobs with this slide is proclaiming that Apple has written the best Windows app. He's using a huge logo, huge font. Count how many words are on that slide. iTunes. The best Windows app ever written. Like seven words. The key to a great PowerPoint presentation, big font, big graphics. If you use a small font and you read your small font, what happens is the audience, one slide into your presentation, figures out this bozo is reading his slides verbatim. I can read the slides to myself faster than this bozo can read them to me. So why don't I just read ahead? And you lose your audience. If you want a, I realize this is a heavy engineering crowd, I'll give you an algorithm. The algorithm is figure out who the oldest person is in the audience, divide his or her age by two. If you're talking to 60-year-old people,"", ""experts say? My God, Steve is right. You want an open system so you can have an app for that. Number eight, value is not equal to price. There's a difference here. Macintosh, iPhone, iPod, any of those things, anything, is not the cheapest. But arguably, it is the highest value. This is a screenshot from an ad where the Windows guy had to run a bake sale to get money to support the bugs in Windows NT. The Macintosh guy doesn't have to do that because there are less bugs. Effectively, it's saying that, yes, a Macintosh may cost more at the front end, but when you consider training and support and debugging, it is a better value. Price is different from value. Try to never fight on price. Number nine, A players hire A plus players. That is, a good person hires a better person, not a lesser person. What you'll see is that B players, because of their insecurity, like to hire C players. They want to feel better than the person they hired. The problem is when a B player hires a C player, it creates this downward spiral, and the C player hires the D player, and the D player hires the E player. And guess what? Pretty soon, you're surrounded by Z players. This is what we call in Silicon Valley, the Bozo explosion. You need to fight the Bozo explosion. This is a picture of the Macintosh division. This is a reunion held about 25 years after the Macintosh, some of the brightest people I've ever worked with. I consider it an honor to have worked with them. Number 10. Number 10 is that real CEOs demo. They don't pass it to a VP of engineering or a product manager or a PR weenie. They do the demo. Great CEOs can do the demo. This is a picture of Steve demonstrating the Macintosh 128K in 1984. He did the demo by himself. I think many of you will probably start a company one day. Remember this day. If you want to be a great CEO, you have to do the demo. If you cannot do the demo, you are a loser. Do the demo. Number 11. Real entrepreneurs ship. They ship. The way it works in Silicon Valley is we ship and then we test. Except biotech. One of the differences, if you look at this, this is a very early version of essentially a Macintosh. However, it came from Xerox PARC. Xerox PARC pioneered the mouse, graphical user interface, windowing, tiling, drawing with the mouse. All these kinds of things. But the difference between Apple and Xerox PARC is that Apple could ship. You know, there's a great song, Don't Worry, Be Happy, by Bobby McFerrin, right? But really, when it comes to innovation, the correct song is, Don't Worry, Be Crappy. The first Macintosh was arguably a piece of crap, 128K of RAM, 400K floppy drive, no software thanks to me, slow printer, piece of crap. But it was a revolutionary piece of crap. It was better than the best MS-DOS machine, better than the best Apple II. The first laser printer, arguably a piece of crap, $10,000, printing single-sided, 8.5x11, slow AppleTalk network, a piece of crap. But it was so much better than the best daisy wheel printer. It was okay to ship. The way it works in technology is you ship and then you test. Real CEOs ship. Number 12, marketing can be distilled to one simple graph. This graph has two axes. On the vertical axis, we measure uniqueness. On the horizontal axis, we measure value. This is a two-by-two matrix. If any of you go on to work for McKinsey, you will learn that in a two-by-two matrix, you always want the upper right-hand corner. McKinsey will charge you $25,000 for that. So let's discuss all four corners. The bottom right corner is where you create something of value, but it's not unique. There you have to compete on price. Slam operating system on the same hardware, you have to compete on price. The opposite corner, in the opposite corner, you have something truly unique, only you do it, but it is of no value. In that corner, you're just plain stupid. In the bottom left corner, that's what I call the dot-com corner, because there you have a company like pets.com that does something that is of no value and stupid people like me funded 10 other clones of pets.com. So it has no value and it's not unique. That's the worst corner of all. But the corner you want to be in, the holy grail of marketing, the holy grail of entrepreneurship, the holy grail of innovation, the holy grail of making meaning in""]",The speaker worked with Steve Jobs twice in their career.

What makes innovation?,"[""What makes innovation? First quality of innovation is that the product is deep, lots of features, does lots of stuff. You have anticipated what people need before they know they need it. They will not run out of power. Great products, great services are deep. This is an example of a deep product. This is a fanning sandal made by Reef. Every sandal in the world has one primary function, protect your feet. This sandal has twice the functionality. That area that's circled, that's a metal clip. The purpose of that metal clip is to open beer bottles. This sandal has twice the functionality and depth of any other sandal in the world. I use it for intelligence. Great products, great services. When you look at it, you say, wow, somebody was thinking. Somebody was thinking. Somebody is solving my pain. A lot of you are using these flips, these minnows. Somebody was thinking. Somebody said, wow, people want a cheap HD video device, basically no cables, USB device. You stick it in. You don't have to think about it. There's basically one button. You turn it on, boom, you're done. Panasonic. Panasonic looked at people's homes and they said, wow, like my house, we have lots of batteries. We have a freaking jar full of batteries. We have lots of flashlights, none of which work because there's no batteries for them. Why is that? Because the flashlights that we have don't take the size batteries that we have. Panasonic figured out that's a problem, so they created a flashlight that takes three sizes of batteries. Triples the probability that you have the right size battery. C stands for complete. Great products are complete. Great services are complete. When you buy a Lexus, you are not merely buying the steel and the glass and the rubber and the leather. You are buying the totality of the experience. When you buy great software, it's not just the digital download or the DVD that it came on. It's the documentation. It's the online forum. It's the online support. It's the string of enhancements. It's all the good stuff. Great products are complete. And the last thing is E. Great products and services are elegant. They are beautiful. People care about the user interface. So when you go home and you whip out the notes for this session, remember, I want you to jump curves. But ask yourself, are we creating something that's deep, intelligent, complete, and elegant? Because those are the four primary qualities of something that is successfully jumping curves. Roll the dice.""]","Innovation is characterized by four primary qualities: depth, completeness, intelligence, and elegance. A deep product has many features and anticipates user needs, providing more functionality than typical alternatives. Completeness refers to the totality of the experience, encompassing not just the product itself but also support and enhancements. Intelligence means the product effectively solves user pain points, while elegance pertains to the beauty and user interface of the product. Together, these qualities contribute to successful innovation.",We distinguish four characteristics that make products innovative. They are:  - products are deep - they are inteligent - they are complete - they are elegant  Abbriviated nicely as DICE.,1.0,0.7506210121071599,0.9999999999,0.0
